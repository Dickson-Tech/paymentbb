# 2 Description

The Payments Building Block enables digital financial payments to be tracked, evaluated, initiated, validated, processed, logged, compared and verified against budget. This Building Block also provides interoperability with connections to the various external applications that need payment services in order to trigger transitions in their own workflow. Payment services generally interface through gateways to regulated financial entities such as banks, credit facilities, and insurance companies. To help users easily complete payment transactions and learn if their transaction succeeded or failed, it converts heterogeneous interface protocols, formats, and user interfaces to a standard set of common interfaces and formats. It can also help in tracking the costs of commodity and equipment purchases to optimize budgets.

The Payments Building Block consists of components that enable multiple use cases in a generic manner. The use cases include Government to Person (G2P), Person to Government (P2G), Government to Business (G2B), and Business to Government (B2G). The existing commercial Payments schemes are heterogeneous across regions and countries, the Payments Building Block assumes that some components are optional when considering implementation. The Payments Building Block covers components that can be used to deliver the key functionalities and the connections to existing systems in the market but does not contemplate building a new Payments scheme.

### Financial Inclusion, Banks, and Mobile Money Accounts <a href="#docs-internal-guid-40250f7c-7fff-0e7b-4de3-b9ba0376cbfc" id="docs-internal-guid-40250f7c-7fff-0e7b-4de3-b9ba0376cbfc"></a>

Financial inclusion strategies have largely been based on growing access to regulated accounts. These were traditionally understood to be bank accounts, in recent years Mobile Money (MoMo) accounts have greatly increased transactional account access. These MoMo accounts are often, but not always, treated as secondary to the banking system and lack interoperability.

That said, today, with over 1.2 billion global accounts, transacting an average of over $2 billion per day, mobile money has grown to become the leading payment platform in a growing number of emerging markets. Today, there are more mobile money accounts in Sub-Saharan Africa than there are bank accounts. Indeed, during the pandemic, demand for mobile money services increased among businesses, governments, and new services that previously relied on cash or other payment channels.

There are currently active discussions in many markets that need the integration of mobile money into existing national infrastructure. While the integration of mobile money into existing schemes and infrastructure has the potential to create value for all stakeholders in the ecosystem, many legacy payment systems may not be suitable for mobile money integration in their current state. As an example, many existing interbank switches do not support mobile money as a core feature because of legacy technical architecture. What is often missing is the essential capability of the switch to handle high-volume, low-value ﬂows with the mobile number (Mobile Station Integrated Services Digital Network) as identiﬁer for routing and address resolution hence the need for integration. Recent industry developments offer solutions designed to solve many of the issues around the switching of mobile money.

Mobile money providers, regulators, infrastructure providers, and other financial system players should seek to engage in any potential interoperability initiatives from an early stage to ensure optimal payment system design for all parties. Should existing infrastructure be used, a thorough assessment should be conducted, with input from all parties, to ensure appropriate governance, commercial, and technical standards are incorporated. Mandating interoperability within a short time frame removes opportunities for a thoughtful and holistic analysis of commercial sustainability. Requiring immediate interoperability can also delay or hamper the uptake of interoperable transactions, and mobile money services altogether. This is a particular risk in contexts where regulators or governments impose immediate connections to a centralized hub. Mobile money providers should be encouraged to connect when their service is ready. However alternative modalities of payment such as cash vouchers can also be considered in scenarios of low-resource regions that lack modern infrastructure and a volume of mobile phone users. Also, in countries where mobile money providers are not connected to a payment switch, aggregators can enable the flow of funds between multiple financial service providers including banks and non-banks. While aggregators may not be as efficient and scalable as switches, they can help solve interoperability issues in the short and medium term.

## Payments Building Block Capabilities <a href="#docs-internal-guid-4991f911-7fff-c25a-2bb0-29f7dbf71bcb" id="docs-internal-guid-4991f911-7fff-c25a-2bb0-29f7dbf71bcb"></a>

Generally, the Building Block is supportive of multiple types of payment use cases where the Government is one of the parties:

* **Government to people (G2P)**
  * Payment where the payer is a government and the payee is an individual e.g. Social benefits disbursement, government salary payments, Conditional and [Unconditional Social Cash Transfers](https://solutions.dial.community/use\_cases/unconditional\_social\_cash\_transf/use\_case\_steps/outreach\_communications)).
* **People to Government (P2G)**
  * Payment where the payer is an individual and the payee is a government. P2G payments can be government initiated, for instance, in the case of payments for registrations for government services. For bill payments and payments for government services directly by the person, the system should provide the person with the flexibility to choose which payment instrument to use (eg. mobile money, bank transfer or card payments). (e.g. payment of taxes, payment[ Registration for Postpartum and Infant Care](https://github.com/GovStackWorkingGroup/BuildingBlockAPI/issues/1), payment of school fees, driving license, utility payments).
* **Government to Business (G2B)**
  * G2B payments include tax refunds, goods and services purchases, subsidies, contract payments, benefits, and loans.
* **Business to Government (B2G)**
  * B2G payments include paying taxes and fees.
* **Government to Government (G2G)**
  * Payments between two government entities (i.e. between Ministries/Departments and public sector institutions).

Government to Business payments (G2B) and Government to Government (G2G) are not covered in this specification and will be covered in the second phase.

## Mapping Based on Level of Maturity <a href="#docs-internal-guid-03083e3a-7fff-0a23-35b3-cf8f18b3f1a2" id="docs-internal-guid-03083e3a-7fff-0a23-35b3-cf8f18b3f1a2"></a>
